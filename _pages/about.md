I'm a 4th year PhD student at the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute [(Mila)](https://mila.quebec/) and an intern at [ElementAI](https://www.elementai.com/) under the supervision of [Laurent Charlin](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~lcharlin/) and [Pau Rodriguez](https://prlz77.github.io/), respectively.

I'm interested in algorithms able to accumulate transferable knowledge or skills enabling generalization to future tasks. Consequently, my research topics lies in continual learning and meta-learning. My [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05856) proposes a new and more realistic approach to continual learning at the intersection of both fields.

I'm currently working on Continual Reinforcement Learning, which I believe to be a good testbed for ideas related to *transferable skills acquisition*.
