I'm a third year PhD student at the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (MILA) and an intern at ElementAI under the supervision of Laurent Charlin and Pau Rodriguez, respectively.

I'm interested in algorithms able to accumulate transferable knowledge or skills enabling generalization to future tasks. Consequently, my research topics lies in continual learning and meta-learning. My recent work proposes a new and more realistic approach to continual learning at the intersection of both fields.
