I'm a 4th year PhD student at the Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute (MILA) and an intern at ElementAI under the supervision of Laurent Charlin and Pau Rodriguez, respectively.

I'm interested in algorithms able to accumulate transferable knowledge or skills enabling generalization to future tasks. Consequently, my research topics lies in continual learning and meta-learning. My [recent work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05856) proposes a new and more realistic approach to continual learning at the intersection of both fields.

I'm currently working on Continual Reinforcement Learning, which I believe to be a good testbed for ideas related to *transferable skills accumulation*.
